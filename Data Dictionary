Data is a time series of runs where some runs are critical (have an 'Error' measured) and non-critical (no 'Error' is available or applicable).

Goal:
    Establish if there is any correlation between "feature"/"attribute" (or combination of features/attributes) running just 
    before any particular lot that drives the probability of larger abs value of Error.  This is directly from the customer who 
    wants to know if there are any set of conditions that increase the likelihood of producing a larger "Error" on a critical plate.  
    Knowing these conditions would allow for the develpment of run rules to prevent running conditions/combinations that increase this
    likelihood.


Entity: string
    individual toolset for that data point.  Each tool is unqiue but a copy exactly of the others so that each tool in the 
    fleet produces the same effect.

Run_On_Ent: integer
    the sequential run on that specific entity.  The sequence matters!

Lot: string
    The name/identifier of that run

Operation: int
    Operation associated w that particular run 

Error: float
    Key parameter for the analysis.  Can we predict a larger/smaller Error on a run (n) given the lots that ran just before it (n-1,n-2,...
    n-j, where j = how far back in runs to look)?  Error can be both positive or negative.  Run is critical if Error is available.  
    NaN means no value is applicable or available.

Feature1-4: int or float
    unique features of that run

Attribute1-5: boolean
    represent physical materials present on that run

Fam_Type/DIC_Design: string
    description of the type of critical run - has an Error value associated with it
