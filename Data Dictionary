Data is a time series of runs where some runs are critical (have an 'Error' measured) and non-critical (no 'Error' is available or applicable).

Goal:
    establish if there is any correlation between "feature"/"attribute" (or combination of features/attributes) running just before any particular lot that drives the probability of larger abs value of Error.  


Entity: string
    individual toolset for that data point.  Each tool is unqiue but a copy exactly of the others so that each tool in the 
    fleet produces the same effect.

Run_On_Ent: integer
    the sequential run on that specific entity.  The sequence matters!

Lot: string
    The name/identifier of that run

Operation: int
    Operation associated w that particular run 

Error: float
    Key parameter for the analysis.  Error can be both positive or negative.  Run is critical if Error is available.  NaN means no value is applicable or available.

Feature1-4: int or float
    unique features of that run

Attribute1-5: boolean
    represent physical materials present on that run

Fam_Type/DIC_Design: string
    description of the type of critical run - has an Error value associated with it
